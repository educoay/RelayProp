# PyRelayControl
*<a href="https://www.learnpyqt.com/" target="_blank">PyQt5</a> GUI app to configure the wiring and control the relays.*


## Installation

### Installation on Windows

1. First install Python 3.8.x in `C:\Python38` ([Windows x86-64 executable installer](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.8.2/python-3.8.2-amd64.exe) from <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-382/" target="_blank">python.org</a>)

2. Download [`RelayControlInstallation.zip`](https://github.com/xcape-io/RelayProp/raw/master/PyRelayControl/RelayControlInstallation.zip) from this GitHub repository 

3. Unflate it in a folder of your choice (for *<a href="https://xcape.io/" target="_blank">xcape.io</a> Room* users, choose the **Plugins** folder).

4. Run `install.bat` with a double-click to create the Python virtual environment (*venv*).

5. Set MQTT broker IP address in `constants.py`

    ```python
    MQTT_DEFAULT_HOST = 'localhost'  # replace localhost with your broker IP address
    ```

6. Run `test.bat` to test your new settings app.

### Installation on Debian based Linux distros
*PyRelayControl* is a pure python applet so you can install it on any computer running python with <a href="https://www.learnpyqt.com/" target="_blank">PyQt5</a>.

#### Example of installation on Ubuntu/Debian based distros
You will have to install following Python packages:
```bash
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install python3-pip
$ pip3 install --user pyqt5
$ sudo apt-get install python3-pyqt5
$ sudo apt-get install qt5-default pyqt5-dev pyqt5-dev-tools
```

Then:

1. Download [`RelayControlInstallation.zip`](https://github.com/xcape-io/RelayProp/raw/master/PyRelayControl/RelayControlInstallation.zip) from this GitHub repository 

2. Unflate it in a folder of your choice

3. From this folder, install requirements
    ```bash
    $ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Start the settings app, assuming your MQTT broker IP address is 192.168.1.42
    ```bash
    $ python3 main.py -s 192.168.1.42
    ```

### Installation on Raspberry Pi (Raspbian)
With the new Raspberry Pi 4 with 2 HDMI outputs and 4GB memory, controlling your escape room with a Raspberry Pi starts to make sense.

You will have to install following Python packages:
```bash
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install qt5-default pyqt5-dev pyqt5-dev-tools
$ sudo apt-get install python3-pyqt5 python3-pyqt5-dbg
```

Then:

1. Download [`RelayControlInstallation.zip`](https://github.com/xcape-io/RelayProp/raw/master/PyRelayControl/RelayControlInstallation.zip) from this GitHub repository 

2. Unflate it in a folder of your choice

3. From this folder, install requirements
    ```bash
    $ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Start the settings app, assuming your MQTT broker IP address is 192.168.1.42
    ```bash
    $ python3 main.py -s 192.168.1.42
    ```

### Installation on Mac

PyQt5 installation on Mac can be tricky, see <a href="https://www.learnpyqt.com/installation/installation-mac/" target="_blank">PyQt5 installation on Mac at LearnPyQt</a>.


## Usage
At fisrt start (`prop.ini` not created yet), configure the relay prop:

![](https://github.com/xcape-io/RelayProp/blob/master/docs/screenshots/configure-prop.png?raw=true)

To configure the Relay prop:

1. Choose Arduino or Raspberry board model
2. Set board option if any (Dragino YÃºn shield or MCP23017 expander)
3. Edit prop MQTT topics (inbosd/outbox/wiring)
4. Set MQTT broker IP address and port 

At first start, when choosing board model:

* prop name is filled with a default name
* inbox topic is filled with *xcape.io* recommandations
* outbox topic is filled as well
* wiring topic is filled too

When you apply the prop settings, the control panel appears as well as the wiring dialog (because, it' first start).

### Wiring configuration

![](https://github.com/xcape-io/RelayProp/blob/master/docs/screenshots/wiring-start.png?raw=true)

Click on a pin button to configure:

![](https://github.com/xcape-io/RelayProp/blob/master/docs/screenshots/pyrelaysettings-pin.png?raw=true)

> To move a configuration to another pin, select an available pin in the output field.

When all pins are configured (they are saved to a local JSON file), you have to **Upload wiring to broker** so the prop receives the wiring and setup itself its GPIO and commands.

### Build the control panel

This is done in one-click on **Rebuild panel from new wiring**:

![](https://github.com/xcape-io/RelayProp/blob/master/docs/screenshots/build-panel.png?raw=true)

Passing by, you may fill SSH credentials for **Relaunch** and **Reboot** button.

All widgets are light switches and they are gouped  (for variable with `/` separtor like `maglocks/*`):

You can **Edit captions and indicators**:

![](https://github.com/xcape-io/RelayProp/blob/master/docs/screenshots/edit-panel.png?raw=true)

The panel widgets editor before customization:

The panel widgets editor after customization:

![](https://github.com/xcape-io/RelayProp/blob/master/docs/screenshots/panel-edition-2.png?raw=true)

You can **change** captions and switch images, **move** the groups up and down and **hide** widgets or entire groups.

Eventually, the final control panel:

For Raspberry Pi prop, **Relaunch** button edition is enabled:

The SSH command is set by default for the <a href="https://github.com/xcape-io/RelayProp/tree/master/PiPyRelayProp#ssh-relaunch-command" target="_blank">PiPyRelayProp</a>, you may have to change the script path:
